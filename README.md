## What is Mnemonic Bitcoin Puzzle ?

### Description

**The challenge involves deciphering a hidden mnemonic phrase embedded in the article** :
[Securing Bitcoin Seed Phrases in Stories](https://medium.com/coinmonks/securing-bitcoin-seed-phrases-in-stories-d8eb43a02254).

### History

Created by CoinMonks in 2019, this puzzle introduces an innovative method of embedding recovery phrases into stories to enhance their security.

### Rewards

- **Wallet Address** : [1K4ezpLybootYF23TM4a8Y4NyP7auysnRo](https://btcscan.org/address/1K4ezpLybootYF23TM4a8Y4NyP7auysnRo)
- **Prize**: `0.0312463 BTC` _(~$2,903 at the time of writing)_

### Hints

To participate, **extract the words from the article** and **reconstruct the mnemonic phrase that unlocks the Bitcoin wallet.**

## Features

- 🔍 **Specific Wallet Search**
  <br>_Find the mnemonic of a specific Bitcoin wallet._

- 🎲 **Custom Mnemonic Length Generation**
  <br>_Generate mnemonics of various lengths (**12** and **24 words**)._

- 🆕 **Unique Mnemonic Generation**
  <br>_Generates unique mnemonics and records each attempt in a SQLitedatabase to avoid duplication, ensuring no repetition even after restarting the program._

- 🧠 **Previously Generated Mnemonics**
  <br>_Handling Loads and skips mnemonics that have already been generated to ensure a unique search._

- 🚀 **Optimized Multi-Threading for Efficient Search**
  <br>_Searches for private keys faster using a multi-threaded approach with dynamic thread allocation based on mnemonic lengths._

- 🔐 **License Key Login System**
  <br>_Secure authentication via an unique license key._

- 📊 **Real-Time Display**
  <br>_Option to display each search attempt in real time._

- 💾 **Result Recording**
  <br>_Automatic saving of found mnemonic, private key and wallet addresses._

- 💻 **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
  <br>_Works on Mac, Windows, and Linux._

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11
- Required Python libraries (_see [Installation](#installation)_)
  - `base58`
  - `bip32utils`
  - `bit`
  - `mnemonic`
  - `shadePy`

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository to your machine**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/0x414854/Mnemonic_Hunt.git
   ```

   ```bash
   cd Mnemonic_Hunt

   ```

2. **Run the following command to install libraries**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare the necessary files**

- `users.csv` : **Contains usernames and license keys**
  <br>_You can generate a license key using the_ [Generate_License_Key](https://github.com/0x414854/Generate_License_Key) _repository._
- `words.txt`: **Contains the wordlist**

4. **You're ready to run the program** !

   ```bash
   python3 mnemonicHunt.py
   ```

## **Usage**

1. **Run the script**

   ```bash
   python3 mnemonicHunt.py
   ```

2. **Connect to the Bot**
   <br><br>**If the `license key` is not valid, **return to the home screen.**
   <br>If the authentication is incorrect **more than three times**, **the program will close\*\*.

3. **Display each attempt**
   <br>Choose whether to display each attempt or not when prompted then the search process begins automatically.

4. **Search begin !**

### Output

- Matching mnemonics, private keys, and wallet addresses are saved in `ENJOY/Enjoy.txt`.

## 🔒 **Security and Ethics**

### **Your Data is Safe**

- All operations performed by **Mnemonic Hunt** are entirely local to your system.
- The tool does not send or receive any data over the internet.
- Sensitive files like `mnemonicHunt.log` and `users.csv` remain on your local machine.

By keeping all processes offline, we ensure that **your data stays private and secure**.

### ⚠️ **Disclaimer**

**Mnemonic Hunt** is intended for :

- Research purposes.
- Educational use.
- Solving Bitcoin puzzles and cryptographic challenges legally and ethically.

**Misuse of this tool for unauthorized access or illegal purposes is strictly prohibited and may violate laws in your jurisdiction.**

<!--
## Benchmarks

Performance metrics:

- Average mnemonics tested per second: 1000+ with multithreading.
- Successful discovery time depends on the complexity of the phrase.

## **Roadmap**

- [ ] 💾 **Enable sharing generated mnemonic**
- [ ] `Optimize private key calculations`
- [ ] `Optimize threading`
- ✅ `Manage mnemonics in a SQLite database`
